Program Description
The Game Development bootcamp at Vertex School introduces you to the real-time skills that define the core of most game development disciplines. In this program, you will learn the fundamentals of the game development pipeline.

The program is going to do this through a simplified game development pipeline. First thing you’re going to make a level; put some stuff in that level; light it, and set up materials; design the game loop; program the characters and the environment; create the UI and package it up.

Working inside of unreal engine, your builds skills in environment, tech aren’t, programming, tool, building, and game design. We’re super excited to have you here and look forward to seeing what dreams you come up with.

 

Game Development Foundations
Course Description
The Game Artist Development Foundations course will help you to learn the technical skills while also developing your artistic eye. These skills apply to many industries that utilize real time rendering, including but not limited to: Video Games, Virtual Production, Vehicle Automation, Simulation, and XR Simulation.

Learning Outcomes
By the end of the foundations course, you should be able to:

Create real-time 3D environments
Create interactivity in the environment
Create a game-loop and wrapper for your application
Create AI for your application
Package the game into an executable file
Build custom tools to aid in the creation of your 3D application
Prerequisites
Students should have a general knowledge of game development, 3D modeling programs and computer games.

Course Breakdown and Schedule
Intro to Game Development (Skill Building)
The first course is about skill building while gaining a general understanding of the Game Development Pipeline. You will be learning technical skills and discovering workflows that align with industry standards. You will develop your modeling and texturing skills while simultaneously adapting to pipelines specifically tailored to Real Time 3D applications. These skills apply to many industries that utilize real time rendering.

Game Development Intermediate
Course Description
In the intermediate game development course, you will take the skills that you have learned in foundations to create a game capstone, which will be a more enhanced experience than your first game. In this course you will learn the technical skills you need to create an engaging game that can function as a minimum viable product (MVP). 

In addition to these technical skills, you will also learn how to work with Unreal Engine’s python and C++ API’s to further develop your development skills. These are the techniques used by all successful AAA game studios.  Video games are not the only industry where these skills are relevant. Many industries (not just games) are moving towards heavier usage of real time technology. Game, film, VR.... even healthcare and logistics! 

Learning Outcomes
By the end of the Environment Art course, you should be able to:

Create an enhanced 3D application
Speed up your workflow using python
Program interactivity with C++
Tell a story with your application using environment design, interactivity and narrative
Learn optimization techniques to fulfill platform requirements
Create compelling renders and video of your real time environment
Use version control to manage the development application
Course Breakdown and Schedule
Intermediate Game Development
The aim of this course is to get you thinking like a game developer or technical artist. This means shifting your focus to be able to see both the entire game and the individual mechanics. Each sprint you will be learning topics and theories that are essential to Unreal Engine generalists and technical artists. Game Developers have a large toolkit they need to master, so our main focus here will be getting acquainted with these topics as quickly as possible.

Project Milestones:

Thinking like a game developer
Understanding project structure and game design concepts
Environment and Level design
Creating Worlds with Unreal Engine
Working with terrain, foliage, and Megascans
Exploring lighting and composition in a nature scene
Games as Software
Architecting your Application and Game Framework
Programming tools, interactivity
using object oriented principles of programming
Game Capstone II
Now that you have a more advanced skill set, it’s time to start building your 3D application.

In the intermediate game capstone, it’s time to build a more complete 3D application. This application can be a game or other type of 3D interactive product. While you are working on your project, you will also be following along with an instructor’s project as they go through the process. We will spend time fixing bugs, optimizing code, and building functionality in efficient ways. The capstone will be evaluated based on milestones.

The course is managed using a milestone system. Each week, you will complete milestones that can include a concept component, development component and a programming component. Each milestone component will be completed weekly.

Student Expectations
General Participation
Being a game artist is just like being any other artist. It’s about community and respect. Participating within your course means:

Consistently Attend Class and small group or one on one sessions
Arrive on Time 
Provide as much notice as possible if you will be absent
Be respectful of your mentor’s time
Be respectful of your peers’ right to have time with mentors
Engage thoughtfully and respectfully with with the community
Help create a supportive environment
Provide meaningful and respectful feedback
Demonstrate that you have consumed the provided training content
Consistently turn in assignments on time
Consistently post work updates in between required posting
Doing The Work
At Vertex, our focus is on the work. Every topic is accompanied by assignments where you will practice the techniques you have learned. You will receive feedback both from your mentors and your peers, just as you will be providing feedback to your peers. Our mantra is Post Early, Post Ugly, and Post Often. The more you post, the more opportunities you have to receive feedback and the more feedback you receive, the more you grow.

Always make sure your work updates are posted in the appropriate place before you meet with your mentor or class. A mentor should never have to ask you for your work. You should always be prepared ahead of time and eager to share. When in doubt on when you should post work updates, remember:

Early is on time
On time is late
Late is unacceptable
Community Participation
During the course you will interact with instructors, mentors, and other students. While much of your live interaction will be in small groups or one on one with mentors, every student is still expected to participate in the community. You will be posting updates to your work to your designated cohort channels where your peers have the opportunity to provide feedback on your work. You will also participate in providing feedback for your peers’ work. As artists, we grow stronger through both mentor and peer critique.

 

Grading and Evaluation
There are two types of assignments:

Skill Building Assignments: Small projects that you work through to demonstrate an understanding of the topic. These are deadline based and primarily aimed at learning the technical skills. These are graded on a per assignment basis. As these are skill based, meeting deadlines is 75% of the grade for each assignment. The remaining 25% for each assignment is based on mastery of the skill topic.  Turning in your assignments on time (meeting the deadline or earlier) usually means a 100% for that assignment.

Project Milestones: Milestones act as checkpoints during capstone projects. While you should aim to hit the deadlines, these are more about honing your artistic eye and tend to be more flexible. Project milestones are about achieving the quality threshold. Capstone projects are assigned a completion grade at the end of the project.

Rubric: During The Game Capstone projects, your game will be evaluated on the specific job hiring triggers used in the industry:

Scene Composition
Convincing and natural appearance to scene
Efficient lighting using appropriate light types
Level Design that has been tested and guides the player
Light balance and shadows
