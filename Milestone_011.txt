Playtesting Making a project from start to finish in Unreal Engine is no small task. However, making a game that is fun and engaging is an entirely different one. We have people playtest games because that is the end goal of the game. It is ultimately a product that others consume. When conducting a playtesting session, there are a few rules that are good to follow. 
               1. Keep as quiet as possible. This will help you to discover how intuitive your UI/UX is.  

               2. Log all questions and feed back. If the person is trying to be helpful, you will receive honest feedback and a helpful discussion.

               3. Playtest with intent. Have some questions prepared to ask the player at the end of the session.
