Assignment

This assignment, you will build a master material that you can use to quickly add textures (from custom props, or megascans). Then you will create a material instance of the material, populate it, and use it some way in your level. Try to be creative with your material. 

Then you will create two other materials that you can use in your environment that follow the physical parameters of specific metal or glass types in the Unreal Engine Documentation.

Note: One of these materials needs to be animated and consist of material layers.

You will submit screenshots of your material networks for each material
You will submit a screenshot of your material used in a level in a creative way that makes sense with your environment. 
You will need to make a video of your animated material. 
Upload all the items to syncsketch and then submit the link in this assignment for review.
