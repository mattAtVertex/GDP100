A landscape has 3 components: Landscape, Landscape Material, Foliage.  For the project, you will create a complete Landscape that suits the environment design for your game.  We will work with Megascans surfaces for our textures and use foliage from Megascans as well. 

An atmosphere has 5 components: Sky Atmosphere Actor, Volumetric Cloud Actor, Exponential Height fog Actor, Directional Light Actor, Skylight Actor.  These actors all exist in the engine and combine to create an atmosphere.
